## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(PlayerType)](./bge-core.game._constructor_.md) | <code>protected</code> | Base constructor for <code>Game&lt;TPlayer&gt;</code>. You need to pass in your player type here so that BGE knows how to make instances of it. |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [children](./bge-core.game.children.md) | <code>readonly</code> | [DisplayContainer](./bge-core.displaycontainer.md) | Dynamically add or remove objects to be displayed here. |
|  [delay](./bge-core.game.delay.md) | <code>readonly</code> | [Delay](./bge-core.delay.md) | Helper with methods to suspend the game for various amounts of time. |
|  [message](./bge-core.game.message.md) | <code>readonly</code> | [MessageBar](./bge-core.messagebar.md) | Helper for displaying text, buttons and images in the top bar. |
|  [players](./bge-core.game.players.md) | <code>readonly</code> | readonly TPlayer\[\] | Array of all the players in this running game. Only valid after <code>init()</code> has been called. |
|  [random](./bge-core.game.random.md) | <code>readonly</code> | [Random](./bge-core.random.md) | Helper with methods to generate random numbers. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [addPlayerZones(zoneMap, options)](./bge-core.game.addplayerzones.md) |  |  |
|  [all(createPromises)](./bge-core.game.all.md) |  | Creates a Promise that is resolved with an array of results when all of the provided Promises resolve, or rejected when any Promise is rejected. Wraps Promise.all<T>. |
|  [any(createPromises)](./bge-core.game.any.md) |  | Creates a Promise that is fulfilled by the first given Promise to be fulfilled, or rejected with an AggregateError containing an array of rejection reasons if all of the given promises are rejected. All the given promises can still independently fulfill after the first one, unlike with anyExclusive<T>. Wraps Promise.all<T>. |
|  [anyExclusive(createPromises)](./bge-core.game.anyexclusive.md) |  | <p>Creates a Promise that is fulfilled by the first given Promise to be fulfilled, or rejected with an AggregateError containing an array of rejection reasons if all of the given promises are rejected. Unlike any<T>, after any of the given promises fulfills an inner prompt or delay, the other promises are forcibly rejected. This is useful for letting players select from a range of actions, where responding to the first prompt of any action commits that player to only that action.</p><p>Note that you must pass in a function that returns an array of Promises. That function will be invoked once, and only any promises created during invokation will be exclusive. If that function returns promises that were previously created elsewhere, they won't be exclusive.</p> |
|  [getNextPlayer(player)](./bge-core.game.getnextplayer.md) |  | Returns the player following the given one in clockwise turn order. |
|  [onRun()](./bge-core.game.onrun.md) | <p><code>protected</code></p><p><code>abstract</code></p> | Override this to implement your game, moving objects around as players respond to prompts. |
|  [respondToPrompt(playerIndex, promptIndex)](./bge-core.game.respondtoprompt.md) |  | Called by the host when a player has responded to a prompt for input. |
|  [run(players, onUpdateViews)](./bge-core.game.run.md) |  | Called exactly once by a host to run a game. |
