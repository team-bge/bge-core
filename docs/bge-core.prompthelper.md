## PromptHelper class

 Helper to create input prompts for a player.  The prompts will be created as promises that: \* Resolve when the player responds to the prompt \* Reject when the prompt is cancelled

Prompts will cancel if they are created in a `Game.exclusiveAny()` call, and another prompt or delay created in the same call resolved first. Prompts will also cancel when created in a `Game.all()` call, and another promise in that call rejected.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class PromptHelper 
```

## Remarks

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `PromptHelper` class.
